Learn the Basics of YAML

## YAML Stands for: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

YAML is a human-readable data serialization standard: 
---
user 
  - first name : mike
    last name  : stratton
    city            : streetsboro
    
Positioning, through indentation, creates the data structure.
Parsers available in all major languages.
Wide range of language elements: Name/value pairs, lists, arrays, block text (optional white space).
